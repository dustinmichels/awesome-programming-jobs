# Contribution Guidlines

I'm currently editing the info as a CSV (`jobs.csv`) and then rendering the markdown document (`README.md`) from that CSV, using a python script / jupyter notebook (`csv_to_markdown.ipynb`).

The best way to contribute is to simply open the csv file in a spreadsheet application and edit the info there.
